# My first program in COBOL
To understand this program, you need to have basic knowledge in COBOL.
This is the COBOL Practical Course project.
In this program in __COBOL__, I made a scholarship report. Applying everything
learned in Platzi's __COBOL Practical Course__.
The program **shows** a scholarship report, **shows** the name of the student, whether or not the student obtained the scholarship and finally the amount scholarship.
